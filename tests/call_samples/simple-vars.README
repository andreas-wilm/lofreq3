Reads with 10 bases each. 7 reads total. only 2 valid. one with plain bq4 and one with plain bq 6.
change their bases in turn to create one var per pos, thus each having
AF=0.50*,SB=0, DP=2, and DP4=1,0,0,1 or DP4=0,1,1,0

Q should be 19 in both cases since we don't distinguish between refq and alt

```
c = (0.01, 0.001)
library(ppoibin)
nerrs = 1
pv = ppoibin(kk=length(pp)-nerrs, pp=1-pp)
-10.0 * log10(pv)
```
